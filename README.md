# Giraphics
![Banner](https://github.com/tghira16/GiraFix/blob/master/res/banner.svg?raw=true=250x)

Giraphics is graphing and animation library designed to fast and simple to use. The library is inspired by [3b1b]'s [manim] library, but built independently.
## Installation
The core package can be installed with `pip`

```
pip install giraphics
```

Basic graphing and plotting can be done without any other software, however, the following packages are required for full functionality.
* [librsvg]: Used to convert SVG to other image formats
* [ffmpeg]: Used to convert images into a video 
* [tex2svg]: Used to render LaTex

Individual packages can be installed for specific functionality, but installation of all packages is reccomended.
